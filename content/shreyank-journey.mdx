# Welcome to my first article!

Hi! I'm Shreyank Jadiya. I am a full stack developer with a experience of more than 4 years working on latest web development technologies. I specialize in Shopify/Shopify Plus. Ecommerce is something I work with everyday and in this article and all the upcoming one I will try to share more about my thoughts on some of the features and cool tips/tricks about website development. 

I breate shopify and work all day on the shopify planet.So, if you see a whole lot of articles for shopify itself.Don't be disheartened, its something I love the most but I promise I will try to cover other topics as well.

Enough said ! Lets gets on to this article.

This article will be about how i started my website development journey, what inspired me to go into web development and all that. Hopefully, it can also give you some motivation for website development.
